# World_Weather_Analysis

> The purpose of this project was to build on the existing Weather/Vacation app that allowed users to search the weather data at suggested vacation spots based on temperature inputs from the user. The updated that we worked on to improve the app included:
>1. Adding the weather description to the weather data that was already a part of the original project. 
>2. Add input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
>3. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
>4. Using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
